      <h3 class="card-title">Solidarity Score</h3>
      <h2 id="solidarity-score"></h2>
      <p class="card-content">A high solidarity score means you are more likely to feel the same towards an issue as those who are directly affected by it. You see yourself as part of one human family, and the suffering of others moves you to compassion and action. A low score means you may feel detached from the struggles of others or find it hard to relate to their experiences. If you'd like to grow here, try to put yourself in the shoes of people facing hardship. Learn their stories, listen without judgment, and build relationships across divides. The more you know others personally, the more natural solidarity becomes.</p>

      <h3 class="card-title">Family and Community Score</h3>
      <h2 id="family-and-community-score"></h2>
      <p class="card-content">A high score here means you recognize that we're made to live in relationship and take part in the life of our families and communities. You invest in people, contribute to the common good, and build connections that strengthen society. A low score might mean you tend to withdraw, focus mainly on yourself, or avoid engaging with others' needs. To deepen this area, reach out to family or community members you may have drifted from, volunteer locally, or find small ways to participate in building a sense of belonging around you.</p>

      <h3 class="card-title">Rights and Responsibilities Score</h3>
      <h2 id="rights-and-responsibilities-score"></h2>
      <p class="card-content">If you score highly in this teaching, you respect the rights of others and take your own responsibilities seriously. You understand that justice requires both defending the vulnerable and doing your part to uphold fairness. A lower score could suggest you sometimes overlook others' needs or expect rights without considering your duties. To grow, reflect on how your choices affect others and how you might speak up for those whose rights are threatened. Even simple acts—like listening, voting conscientiously, or supporting fair causes—can strengthen justice in daily life.</p>

      <h3 class="card-title">Protection for the Less Fortunate Score</h3>
      <h2 id="protection-for-the-poor-score"></h2>
      <p class="card-content">A high score here means you have a compassionate heart for those in need and make choices that consider how your actions affect the poor and vulnerable. You strive to stand with people who are struggling and work toward a more equitable world. A lower score might mean that the challenges of others feel distant from your own life or that comfort sometimes outweighs compassion. To grow, consider learning about local or global poverty, donating time or resources, or simply being present to someone who needs support. Seeing Christ in those who suffer can deepen empathy and purpose.</p>

      <h3 class="card-title">Care for the Earth Score</h3>
      <h2 id="care-for-creation-score"></h2>
      <p class="card-content">A high score here means you appreciate the world as a sacred gift and strive to live responsibly as a steward of God's creation. You make choices that respect the environment and consider their impact on future generations. A lower score suggests that you may not always think about how your habits affect the earth or the people who depend on it. To grow, take time to enjoy nature, reduce waste, and make small, consistent choices toward sustainability. Caring for creation is caring for all of God's people—especially the poor, who suffer most when the planet is neglected.</p>

      <h3 class="card-title">Workers Rights Score</h3>
      <h2 id="workers-rights-score"></h2>
      <p class="card-content">A high score reflects a healthy respect for work as a form of co-creation with God and a recognition that all workers deserve dignity, fair pay, and safe conditions. You understand that work is not just about personal success, but about serving others. A low score may indicate that you view work mainly as a means to personal gain or overlook injustices in the workplace. To improve, reflect on how your labor and consumption affect others. Support ethical practices, treat coworkers with respect, and value effort over status—seeing work as a vocation rather than just a job.</p>
